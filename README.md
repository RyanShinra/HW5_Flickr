My Code for Homework #5
This is my code for Stanford Course CS193p; I'm not enrolled in the course, I'm following it on iTunes U.
I've found this course to be very helpful in getting a foundation for iOS and Objective-C.
This project uses NSURLSession to communicate with Flickr, and UITableView and associated classes to build the interface.

Full details for the course can be found in iTunesU, including the actual assignment.
